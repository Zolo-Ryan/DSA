This File can be used to create Stack and its necessary functions. Save this code and include it in you file and do

Stack blocks = init(&blocks); // to initialise a stack named "blocks"     
push usage -> push(&blocks,val);     
pop usage -> pop(&blocks);

IMPORTANT NOTE : The stack created will be of 'int' data type and will have max storage of 1000 * 'int'
